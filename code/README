 I have simply downloaded and mirrored all these Arduino libraries here for your convenience.

 I make no promises that you have the latest version of these libraries!
 However, all the libraries should be pretty much up to date and should work fine.

 All credit for this code is due to the respective authors of these libraries!
 Furthermore, all the licenses for these libraries are as specified by the authors!
